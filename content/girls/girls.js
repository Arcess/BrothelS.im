    endurance: "Endurance is how tired the girl currently is. Making her work when her endurance is low will decrease happiness, and she'll also be less effective.",
    happiness: "Happiness is how much she enjoys her job. This goes down any time she refuses to do a task, or when you're not paying her enough. Increase it by paying her more and giving her time off - she's more likely to refuse when unhappy.",
    obedience: "Submission is how likely she is to comply when you or a customer ask her to do tasks some might find distasteful. This increases whenever she refuses. You can decrease it using the Lockdown action, available once you own a building and have purchased a Dungeon.",
    modesty: "Modesty measures how much the girl is willing to expose herself in public, degrade herself in front of a group, or is otherwise shy about her body and conservative in her morals. Any girl willing to work for you is willing to sell her sex for money - but she may not be willing to do it on the street in public!",
    charisma: "Charisma is how outgoing, personable and generally attractive she is. Girls with higher charisma get paid more for prostitution.",
    intelligence: "Intelligence is how quickly she learns. Girls with higher intelligence will gain experience more quickly.",
    constitution: "Constitution is a measure of how quickly she tires. A higher constitution means that Endurance will fall more slowly and recover more quickly.",
    libido: "Libido measures how much she enjoys a particular sex act. Higher values mean she's less likely to refuse and will provide a customer with a better experience.",
    experience: "Experience measures how often a girl has done a particular sex act, and how good she is at pleasuring customers. Higher values will make her less likely to refuse, and customers will pay more."
